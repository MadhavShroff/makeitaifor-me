# Understanding Quantum Computing

Quantum computing is a rapidly emerging technology that harnesses the laws of quantum mechanics to solve problems too complex for classical computers.

## What is Quantum Computing?

Quantum computing is based on quantum bits, or qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously, enabling exponential processing power.
